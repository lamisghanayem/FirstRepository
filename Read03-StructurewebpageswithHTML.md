**Wireframing**

 is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

 **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**
 
  is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

  **Semantics**

  refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
