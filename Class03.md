# Lists in HTML:
1. Ordered Lists : The ordered list is created with the ol element.
2. Unordered Lists: The unordered list is created with the ul element.
**Each item in the list is placed between an opening li tag and a closing li tag**

3. Definition Lists: 
The definition list is created with the dl element and usually consists of a series of terms andtheir definitions. Inside the dl element you will usually see pairs of dt and dd elements.
*dt* This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition term).
*dd* This is used to contain the definition.

**You can put a second list inside an li element to create a sublist or nested list.**

# Basics of JAVASCRIPT:

1. A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 
2. The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter when a step is over.
3. Some statements are surrounded by curly braces;
these are known as code blocks. The closing curly brace is not followed by a semicolon.
4. We should write comments to explain what your code does.
5. To write a comment that stretches over more than
one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with
the /* characters and ending with the */
6. In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash characters//
7. A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
