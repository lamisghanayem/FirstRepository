# Objects in JS

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. 

1. If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property.
2. Properties tell us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.
3. If a function is part of an object, it is called a **method.** 
**method** Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.
4. object is in curly braces. It is stored in a variable.
5. Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name and a value. In an object, that name is called a key. 
6. To access a property or method of an object we use the name of the object followed by a period then the name of property or method you want to access.
