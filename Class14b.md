# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.

2. analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ — isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. 

3. oftware engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. 

4. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. Teammates jump in and out of discussions.

5. Some groups that were ranked among Google’s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room.

6. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.

7. Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly.

8. Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone’s relative strengths.
