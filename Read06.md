**JavaScript function** is a block of code designed to perform a particular task when "something"  calls it.

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}


Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.


Y refers to the function object, and Y() refers to the function result.
Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.
