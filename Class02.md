# Structural markup & Semantic markup

- HTML has six "levels" of headings: h1 is used for main headings, h2 is used for subheadings
- To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening p tag and closing p tag
- By enclosing words in the tags b and /b we can make characters appear bold.
- By enclosing words in the tags i and /i we can make characters appear italic.
- The sup element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.
- to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag br
- The use of the strong element indicates that its content has strong importance. 
 
# Intro to JAVASCRIPT:

1. A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 
2. The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter when a step is over.
3. Some statements are surrounded by curly braces;
these are known as code blocks. The closing curly brace is not followed by a semicolon.
4. We should write comments to explain what your code does.
5. To write a comment that stretches over more than
one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with
the /* characters and ending with the */
6. In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash characters//
7. A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
