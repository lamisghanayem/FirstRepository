# Images in HTML

1. You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS

2. The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element.

3. If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.

# Layouts

1. HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. 
2. The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
3. The nav element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
4. The article element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
5. The aside element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not.
6. The section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
7. The purpose of the hgroup element is to group together a set of one or more h1 through h6 elements so that they are treated as one single heading. 
8. the figure element can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).
