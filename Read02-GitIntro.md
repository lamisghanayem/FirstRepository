**GIT**

 -is a version control system that keeps track of your files and folders, Git is a tool/software like your IDE or VLC player. It is not a programming language.

-it is a history of changes to your files

-it allows people to collaborate together

**Properties:**
commit is the git equivalent of "save as".

Each new version (update on a file with some changes) creates a new snapshot on the timeline of the project.

Git has a a label called head means "you are here".

Each snapshot we creat or commit has a label called message

**There are two main reasons to learn git**

1. Track changes to your code
2. Save your code to the cloud


Tracking changes to your own code is very important. It allows you to do a variety of things such as:
Maintain different versions of the same software (like different versions of an app)
Make sure you never lose any code, recover code changes at any point of time.
Collaborate with others
