email to someone.

Links are created using the -a- element. Users can click on anything between the opening -a- tag and the closing -/a- tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.



## Functions and methods in Java

Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
-*Functions*- consist of series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task.

-*Function Declaration*- To create a function give it a name and then write the statements that needed to achieve its task inside curly braces.

-*Calling Function*- to run the code in the function you write the function name followed by parantheses.


*Function Parameters* if function need information to work, you give it information inside a paranthese after the function name which they are called parameters and they act like variable name.
-*Objects*- to create models of the world using data, and that objects are made up of properties and methods. 

*Built-in Objjects* The browser comes with a set of objects that act for creating interactive web pages. and they are built-in. 

### Pair programming:
pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. 
####pair programming commonly involves two roles:
the Driver and the Navigator.
#### The Driver:
is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.
#### The Navigator:
uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
