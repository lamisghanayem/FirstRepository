# React Lifestyle

1. Render then the componentDidMount.
2. The Mounting phase.
3. constructor, render,React Updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount.

# React State VS Props

1. when we create a componenet inside a react and need to render it, we need to pass it the props that we need to give to it.
2. props you pass into a component and handled outside the componenet, state is handled inside that componenet.
3. when we change the state inside our application.
4. updating the values of forms.
