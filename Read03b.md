**CSS**

(Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages.
CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc.

*There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:*

**External CSS:** Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

**Internal CSS:** is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

**Inline CSS:** to use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

**The color property specifies the color of text:**
we can set it in three different ways:

-Set the text color with an RGB value

-Set the text color with an RGBA value

-Set the text color with a HEX value
