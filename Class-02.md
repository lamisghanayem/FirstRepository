# Structural markup & Semantic markup

- HTML has six "levels" of headings: h1 is used for main headings, h2 is used for subheadings
- To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening p tag and closing p tag
- By enclosing words in the tags b and /b we can make characters appear bold.
- By enclosing words in the tags i and /i we can make characters appear italic.
- The sup element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.
- to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag br
- The use of the strong element indicates that its content has strong importance.
