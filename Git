**Git**

-is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit —
-Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.
-it allows to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN by fetching history information from the server.
-Git makes it difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
-Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
