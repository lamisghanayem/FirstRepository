# How People Access the Web?

## 1-Browsers
People access websites using
software called a web browser, like: Chrome

## 2-Web Servers
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.

# INTO TO HTML
The HTML code is made up of characters these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

**_Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags_**
### EXAMPLE: <p> Hello World </p>


## HTML COMMENTS:
If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these
characters:
<!-- comment goes here -->

## ID ATTRIBUTE: 
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two
elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).

## Class ATTRIBUTE:
Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

## BLOCK Elements:
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. Examples of block elements are <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.

## INLINE ELEMENTS:
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
Examples of inline elements are <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.

## div ELEMENT:
<div> chapter-08/grouping-block-elements.html HTML The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. For example, you might create a <div> element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the navigation), or you might create a <div> element to contain comments from visitors.

### The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
‚óè The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.

### The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

### The <section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading

### The purpose of the <hgroup>
element is to group together a
set of one or more <h1> through
<h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading. 

## DESIGNING PAGES:
1. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
2. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
3. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
4. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
5. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.


# JAVA SCRIPT INTRO:
1. A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
2. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 
3. Programmers write code to make sure when an event occur, apply this code.
4. Webpages are interactive when we write code that make sense which will allow the user to interact with the web page.To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
